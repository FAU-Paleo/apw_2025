#Lee Hsiang Liow Tutorial for Erlangen updated Aug 2025

#Tutorial 4 time series basics and very quick jump to RW, OU in paleoTS and evoTS and then layeranalyzer

#Hopefully this tutorial will show you some of the tools available and some ways to think about temporally organized
#data (very often the case in paleontology)

#The first thing I would like you to do is to try to make a time series using the idea of a random walk. 
#That is, the assignment is to write a basic script to generate a time series, based on only the idea of "walking"
# you can take a step forward or backward, but where you go depends on where you are before, say.
# Try thinking about writing your own script first from first principals. Give yourself at least 5-10 minutes (use your phone)
# Before going to the next line and just looking at the script. I put a bit more distance from here so you are not
#so tempted to look.

#ok, 5-10 minutes is up, and probably you find a more elegant way to simulate the time series than me, but here is my 
#way:

T=200 #no. time steps 
x=0 #starting point : of course you can start where you want
for (i in 1:T) #
{temp=rbinom(1,1,0.5) #toss an even two faced coin, but note of course that you can "walk" different length of the 
#"step" and you can vary the variance of the step distribution etc.
if (temp==1){
  mul=-1 # if toss is 1, minus one
}else{ # if toss is 0, plus one
  mul=1
}
x[i+1]=x[i]+1*mul}#add it to the previous value
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
plot(x, type="l")

#now just do it one more time, it will look different

T=200 #no. steps
y=0 #starting point, now I just call the new time series y
for (i in 1:T) #
{temp=rbinom(1,1,0.5) #toss an even two faced coin
if (temp==1){
  mul=-1 # if toss is 1, minus one
}else{ # if toss is 0, plus one
  mul=1
}
y[i+1]=y[i]+1*mul}#add it to the previous value
plot(y, type="l")

#now let's put two time series which are unrelated to each other (they are both randomly generated by a random walk process)
cor.test(x, y)
#how would you interpret the correlation? 
#Is it "legitimate" do perform a correlation? What about a regression? Try it doing say a linear regression (it's common"!)
plot(x, y)

#here my linear regression of x as a function of y
lm(x~y)
summary(lm(x~y)) #look at what it says and what you will conclude if you report p values.

# As an exercise you can try making first differences out of x and y and see if your results change. And make loops to do it many time
#What do your correlation 
#values look like and do you think you can use first differences to tell you something about "causation"?


#https://nicolarighetti.github.io/Time-Series-Analysis-With-R/basic-concepts.html
#a nice set of tutorials for "standard" time series analyses, and I cite the author here:
#"A time series is a serially sequenced set of values representing a variable value at different points in time 
#(VanLear, “Time Series Analysis”). It consists in measures collected through time, at regular time intervals, 
#about an unit of observation, resulting in a set of ordered values. This regularity is the frequency of time series 
#(which can be, for instance, hourly, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly etc.)."

#This definition of time series (above) is a bit too restrictive for us. Many paleo and geo time series are not and cannot
#be collected at regular time intervals. In the next short section though, we whiz through some typical
#time series descriptors. Many paleo papers force their time series data to be temporally "regular" by binning data by time chunks.
#This decision (think about assumptions of models and assumptions of methods) sometimes can really affect inferences.

#https://nicolarighetti.github.io/Time-Series-Analysis-With-R/time-series-objects.html#time-series-objects-1
#data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vzpdPFb_ihBlqqbHxJS7mEvzQ3tNhmEm/view
#elections are important for many of us, so let's play with some of that
elections_news <- read.csv("elections-stories-over-time-20210111144254.csv")
str(elections_news)
#change the "date" to date format (it's read as character strings or "chr")
elections_news$date <- as.Date(elections_news$date)

#always plot your raw data, don't start fitting models before you know what your data looks like and you have
#thought about your data. It's too easy not to dive deep into data that you can download from databases etc! 
#think about assumptions, how the data are actually collected, their limitations for perhaps the questions you
#are asking etc.

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(elections_news$date,elections_news$ratio, type="l") # the ratio of news items that are about the elections
#it's about 6 years of daily counts and ratios of news ratios, the kind of length of time series data (i.e.
#number of time points) that we almost never have, but that sometimes paleoenvironmental proxies from the 
#past may have...

#let's see if there is temporal autocorrelation (it is "auto" beacuse it is how data in the time series
#is related to itself)
acf_res=acf(elections_news$ratio, ci=0.95) #the default lag  for this data is is two months 
#if you need the values to be output just use
acf_res
#or 
acf(elections_news$ratio, plot=F)
#Q what are the blue dashed lines)?
?acf # this shows the autocorrelation of the time series

# you can see that when there is no lag, the time series is compare "directly" with itself at the same time points, and there is 
#full correlation, that's expected. As the lag grows, the correlation drops, but this figure shows that there is temporal
#autocorrelation in the data (makes sense if you think about it right? The daily news you read tend to be related to what was on the day before
#Taylor Swift today, Taylor Swift tomorrow too, etc, but it might dwindle over time, just like temporally "bundled" election news )

pacf(elections_news$ratio) # this shows the partial autocorrelation when "measures the correlation between  
#x_t and  x_(t+k) after it has stripped out the effect of the intermediate (in between) x’s; blue line:
#if time series is white noise, should autocorrelation zero, with some random variation. 
#For a white noise series, we expect 95% of the spikes in the ACF to lie within ±2/√T where T is the length of the time series. 
#the ±2/√T are the blue dashed lines  If one or more large spikes are outside these bounds
#or if substantially more than 5% of spikes are outside these bounds, then the series is probably not white noise.

#read https://nicolarighetti.github.io/Time-Series-Analysis-With-R/correlations-and-arima.html#auto-correlation-acf-and-pacf

#A stationary time series is one whose statistical properties, 
#such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation, remain constant over time. 
#Stationary data is easier to model and analyze. 
#from #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stationarity-of-time-series-data-using-r/
#checking for stationarity, visual or with a test.

#install.packages("tseries") if you don't already have it
library(tseries)
#Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test is a test for stationarity
adf.test(elections_news$ratio)
#p value is less than 0.05, we reject the null (not stationary) the alternative is stationary, so the time series 
#can be considered stationary.
#this also makes sense when you look at the pacf plot before (although it seems a bit border line)

#differencing (Differencing to remove a trend or seasonal effects)
#https://atsa-es.github.io/atsa-labs/sec-tslab-differencing-to-remove-a-trend-or-seasonal-effects.html
# you will likely hear a lot of about "first differencing" in paleo papers.
# first differencing can remove linear trends and might be a bit helpful in reducing the chance
#that two time series that are trending in time for no real reason will not be mistakenly 
#thought to be correlated. 
# you did this yourself above as well.

#white noise
#https://atsa-es.github.io/atsa-labs/sec-ts-definition.html
GWN <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd = 0.2)
plot.ts(GWN)
acf(GWN, main = "", lag.max = 20)
acf(GWN, main = "", lag.max = 99) #are any of the correlations sticking out of the blue dotted lines?
#are you "worried" that the data generated by R is not "white noise"?
adf.test(GWN) #the p value is less than 0.05, so the null is rejected, hence the time series is (as simulated)
#stationary
#now that we know what white noise is, let's think about a type of timeseries that is quite common 
# in the paleo literature, the random walk? 

# Is the random walk (RW) white noise? No, it isn't.
# a random walk is defined as X(at time t)= X (at time t-1) + white noise (at t)

#let's simulate a RW, now we do it more "efficiently" in the code than I did before when I was going "step by step"
set.seed(123)
## length of time series
TT <- 100
## initialize {x_t} and {w_t}
xx <- ww <- rnorm(n = TT, mean = 0, sd = 1) #so now both xx and ww contain the same 
#100 values that are generated from a random normal distribution, which is white noise (wn)
# we keep xx[1] as it is, but then from xx[2] onwards, we add wn
## compute values 2 thru TT
for (t in 2:TT) {
  xx[t] <- xx[t - 1] + ww[t]
}

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
## plot line
plot.ts(xx, ylab = expression(italic(x[t])))
## plot ACF
acf(xx)
adf.test(xx) # null is not rejected so this is a non-stationary time series

#there is a lot more to time series analyses, and there are many tutorials available, including the ones I have suggested here
#from which I used some material. 
# you may also read/hear about time-domain (what we have done so far) and frequency-domain (wavelet, spectral analyses, useful for time series with periodic 
#behavior. Some paleo literature talk about the cyclicity of extinctions and may thus use frequency-domain tools but 
#more often than not we do not have enough time points to study cyclcity.

#But let's now turn to time series tools in R that are available for paleo just so you get introduced to their
#uses 

#PaleoTS is an R package written by Gene Hunt first to study Punc-Eq but then has evolved to doing more. It was one of the earlier 
#uses of model comparisons (e.g. via AIC) to select models. Classically, folks tried to distinguish between random walks, a specific case of rw with a directional trend
# & stasis (wn) mostly looking at univariate morphological data, like body size.
#evolTS, another R package, is a follow up to PaleoTS, expanding on it, written by Kjetil Voje.
#install these if you don't have them using
#install.packages("paleoTS")
#install.packages("evoTS")
#then load them

library(paleoTS)
library(evoTS)

#the data are from a diatom lineage that invaded Yellowstone lake after the recession of ice, see Theriot 1992 and
#Theriot et al. 2006. So we are following morphological changes here from a lake core. Three morphological traits
#were measured, diameter, the number of ribs and the number of spines
# I got this data nicely tidied up from Voje 2020 paper see doi:10.1111/evo.13838

#"Under the simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model, a continuous character is assumed to evolve toward an 
#optimal value, θ
#The character evolves stochastically according to a drift parameter, σ2
#The character is pulled toward the optimum by the rate of adaptation, α
#larger values of alpha indicate that the character is pulled more strongly toward θ
#As the character moves away from θ the parameter α
#determines how strongly the character is pulled back. For this reason, α
#is sometimes referred to as a ‘‘rubber band’’ parameter. When the rate of adaptation parameter α=0
#the OU model collapses to the BM model."
