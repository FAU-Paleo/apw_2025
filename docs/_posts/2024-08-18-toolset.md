### Goodies

#### Learning the terminal and git

- [Unix Workbench coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix)
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)


#### Books on R

- [R Resources](https://adamtkocsis.com/rkheion/Resources.html)


#### Making a website with `academicpages`

- Go to [Acadmic pages (example jekyll)](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), and fork the repository!
- Go to your forked version of the repository. Go to `Settings`, and then to `Pages` (currently under the section `Code and automation`). 
- Under `Build and deployment` select the source: **Build from a branch**. And in Branch select `master`, and `/root` and hit save.
- The page will take some time to build. If you go on the repository's main page, there will be an *orange dot* next to the commit hash. When the page is ready, this will change to a green checkmark. 
- If you go the settings page where you set up the things above, you should see the URL to the webpage. This URL will typicall be: `https://<yourgithubname>.github.io/<reponame, i.e. academicpages>/`.
- If you want to make a webpage with the URL `https://<yourgithubname>.github.io/`, you have to create a repository called `<yourgithubname>.github.io`. 
- You can also set up a custom domain for this page. See [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) to find out how.

## Some missing notes

#### Wrtiting shell scripts

(BASH) Shell scripts can be run directly with the `bash` console application: If your code file is called `my_code.sh` (.sh is the typical extension for shell scripts) you can run it with: 

```sh
bash my_code.sh
```

Alternatively, you can make the file a proper executable. For that it has to start with a 'shebang', which is a commented line that looks like this:

```
#!/bin/bash
```

Then you need to change its mode to become executable with:

```sh
chmod +x my_code.sh
```

which you can confirm with `ls -l`. Once the file is executable, you can run it by typing in its path to the console. For files in your current working directory, you have to point to the current working directory:

```sh
./my_code.sh
```

Or you have to add the file's directory to the `PATH` environment variable.
