#### Making a website with `academicpages`

- Go to [Acadmic pages (example jekyll)](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), and fork the repository!
- Go to your forked version of the repository. Go to `Settings`, and then to `Pages` (currently under the section `Code and automation`). 
- Under `Build and deployment` select the source: **Build from a branch**. And in Branch select `master`, and `/root` and hit save.
- The page will take some time to build. If you go on the repository's main page, there will be an *orange dot* next to the commit hash. When the page is ready, this will change to a green checkmark. 
- If you go the settings page where you set up the things above, you should see the URL to the webpage. This URL will typicall be: `https://<yourgithubname>.github.io/<reponame, i.e. academicpages>/`.
- If you want to make a webpage with the URL `https://<yourgithubname>.github.io/`, you have to create a repository called `<yourgithubname>.github.io`. 
- You can also set up a custom domain for this page. See [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) to find out how.
