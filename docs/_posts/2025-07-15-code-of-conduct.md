The 2025 Analytical Paleobiology Workshop is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all, regardless of background or identity. By participating in the workshop, students, instructors and associated staff (hereafter ‘participants’) accept to abide by this Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. The Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by or affiliated with the workshop, including, but not limited to, teaching sessions, social events, email lists, and online/virtual forums such as GitHub or X.


All participants are expected to behave in a courteous, collegial and respectful fashion, and must show respect for the private and intellectual property of other participants. Disrespectful behavior or behavior that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others will not be tolerated. Discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated, including, but not limited to, discrimination or harassment based on gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, religion or belief, age, education, socio-economic status, and experience level.


**Examples of courteous, collegial and respectful behavior:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing courtesy and respect towards other participants


**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

- Sustained disruption of talks, events or communications
- Harassment in any form, including sexual harassment, denigrating jokes, stereotyping, or a recurring pattern of microinvalidations, microassaults, microaggressions, and microinsults
- Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- Causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking or intimidation
- The display of sexual or violent images
- Nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact or sexual attention
- Continuing to initiate interaction with someone after being asked to stop


### Reporting unacceptable behaviour

If you are the subject of unacceptable behaviour or have witnessed any behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it. This can be done by:

1. Speaking in confidence or to any of the instructors or organizers
2. Writing an email to Adam Kocsis
3. Via the [anonymous reporting form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrLZNLRi4medPAqdJIyVzH8ujW5TspEdZESxZ3UggHiRddnQ/viewform?usp=header)

All reports will be kept in the strictest confidence with details shared only with the Code of Conduct committee members. Once a report is received, the committee will review the incident
and determine the appropriate course of action, which may include, but is not limited to: 

- a. A mandatory conversation with the individual to identify to them their unacceptable
behaviour
- b. Removal of the individual from the workshop
- c. Filing a report with the individual’s home institution

In the case that a committee member is involved in a report, the member will be asked to excuse themselves from ongoing conversations. All violations of the Code of Conduct will be reported to both the local organizing committee and the general Analytical Paleobiology
Workshop organizing committee.
