# Preparatory material


#### R

We expect you to know some basics of R, which you will be using in most modules of the course. This is by far the most useful resource online 

- [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)

We recommend reading through the first chapters in the **Foundations** section! The most vital parts are in the 'Data structures', 'Subsetting', 'Vocabulary', 'Style'  and 'Functions'.

#### Markdown

Markdown is a very simple markup 'language' that can be very easily translated into any other kind of document, such as webpages (html) and pdfs. It is used in web design, programming documentation and tutorials - as well as for taking notes. If you aare not familiar with markdown, you are highly suggested to check it out (just google `'markdown'` and you will find a ton of material, here is a [Markdown Cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)). You are also welcome to do the following formatting tutorial:

- [Dinosaur markdown](https://github.com/adamkocsis/dinosaur-markdown)

Markdown is often used for literate programming, i.e. for writing tutorials and research logs. A dialect of markdown, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is especially efficient at writing good scientific documentation. 

#### Phylogenetics (videos)

We recommened the Paul Lewisâ€™ Phyloseminar lecture series (4 hours of content), which provides an excellent introduction to statistical phylogenetics:
- [Part 1: Trees and Likelihood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r4z0YJq580)
- [Part 2: Substitution models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsLeY0wZr4Y)
- [Part 3a: Bayesian statistics and MCMC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PWlnNsfz90)
- [Part 3b: Bayesian phylogenetics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLtOS--YwkU)
